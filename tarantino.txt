                                 RESERVOIR DOGS

1      INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING

       Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a
       breakfast cafe.  They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,
       MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,
       and the big boss, JOE CABOT.  Most are finished eating and
       are enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a
       small address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and
       involved story about Madonna.

                              MR. PINK 
                 "Like a Virgin" is all about a
                 girl who digs a guy with a big
                 dick.  The whole song is a
                 metaphor for big dicks.

                              MR. BLUE
                 No it's not.  It's about a girl
                 who is very vulnerable and she's
                 been fucked over a few times.
                 Then she meets some guy who's
                 really sensitive--

                              MR. PINK
                 --Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.
                 Tell that bullshit to the
                 tourists.

                              JOE
                         (looking through his
                          address book)
                 Toby...who the fuck is Toby?
                 Toby...Toby...think...think...
                 think...

                              MR. PINK
                 It's not about a nice girl who
                 meets a sensitive boy.  Now
                 granted that's what "True Blue" is
                 about, no argument about that.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Which one is "True Blue?"

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 You don't remember "True Blue?"
                 That was a big ass hit for
                 Madonna.  Shit, I don't even
                 follow this Tops In Pops shit, and
                 I've at least heard of "True
                 Blue."

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Look, asshole, I didn't say I
                 ain't heard of it.  All I asked
                 was how does it go?  Excuse me
                 for not being the world's biggest
                 Madonna fan.

                              MR. BROWN
                 I hate Madonna.

                              MR. BLUE
                 I like her early stuff.  You know,
                 "Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but
                 once she got into her "Papa Don't
                 Preach" phase, I don't know, I
                 tuned out.

                              MR. PINK
                 Hey, fuck all that, I'm
                 making a point here.  You're gonna
                 make me lose my train
                 of thought.

                              JOE
                 Oh fuck, Toby's that little china
                 girl.

                              MR. WHITE
                 What's that?

                              JOE
                 I found this old address book in a
                 jacket I ain't worn in a coon's
                 age.  Toby what?  What the fuck
                 was her last name?

                              MR. PINK
                 Where was I?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 You said "True Blue" was about a
                 nice girl who finds a sensitive
                 fella.  But "Like a Virgin" was a
                 metaphor for big dicks.

                              MR. PINK
                 Let me tell ya what "Like a
                 Virgin"'s about.  It's about some
                 cooze who's a regular fuck
                 machine.
                 I mean all the time, morning, day,
                 night, afternoon, dick, dick,
                 dick, dick, dick,
                 dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
                 dick.

                              MR. BLUE
                 How many dicks was that?

                              MR. WHITE
                 A lot.

                              MR. PINK
                 Then one day she meets a John
                 Holmes motherfucker, and it's
                 like, whoa baby.  This mother
                 fucker's like Charles Bronson in
                 "The Great Escape."  He's diggin
                 tunnels.  Now she's gettin this
                 serious dick action, she's feelin
                 something she ain't felt since
                 forever.  Pain.

                              JOE
                 Chew?  Toby Chew?  No.

                              MR. PINK
                 It hurts.  It hurts her.  It
                 shouldn't hurt.  Her pussy should
                 be Bubble-Yum by now.  But when
                 this cat fucks her, it hurts.  It
                 hurts like the first time.  The
                 pain is reminding a fuck machine
                 what is was like to be a virgin.
                 Hence, "Like a Virgin."

       The fellas crack up.

                              JOE
                 Wong?

                              MR. PINK
                 Fuck you, wrong.  I'm right!  What
                 the fuck do you know about it
                 anyway?  You're still listening to
                 Jerry-fucking-Vale.

                              JOE
                 Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong!  You
                 know, like the Chinese name?

       Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand.  They
       fight, but they're not really mad at each other.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Give me this fucking thing.

                              JOE
                 What the fuck do you think you're
                 doin?  Give me my book back!

                              MR. WHITE
                 I'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe,
                 I'll give it back when we leave.

                              JOE
                 Whaddaya mean, give it to me when
                 we leave, give it back now.

                              MR. WHITE
                 For the past fifteen minutes now,
                 you've just been droning on with
                 names.  "Toby...Toby...Toby...
                 Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby
                 Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan."  I
                 got Madonna's big dick outta my
                 right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-
                 know-what, outta my left.

                              JOE
                 What do you care?

                              MR. WHITE
                 When you're annoying as hell, I
                 care a lot.

                              JOE
                 Give me my book.

                              MR. WHITE
                 You gonna put it away?

                              JOE
                 I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do
                 with it.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna
                 have to keep it.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Joe, you want me to shoot him for
                 you?

                              MR. WHITE
                 Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you
                 better wake up and apologize.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 Have you guys been listening to K-
                 BILLY's super sounds of the
                 seventies weekend?

                              MR. PINK
                 Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 Can you believe the songs they
                 been playin?

                              MR. PINK
                 No, I can't.  You know what I
                 heard the other day?  "Heartbeat -
                 It's Lovebeat," by little Tony
                 DeFranco and the DeFranco Family.
                 I haven't heard that since I was
                 in fifth fuckin grade.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 When I was coming down here, I was
                 playin it.  And "The Night the
                 Lights Went Out in Georgia" came
                 on.  Now I ain't heard that song
                 since it was big, but when it was
                 big, I heard it a million-
                 trillion times.  I'm listening to
                 it this morning, and this was the
                 first time I ever realized that
                 the lady singing the song, was the
                 one who killed Andy.

                              MR. BLUE
                 You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
                 killed the guy?

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 I thought the cheatin wife shot
                 Andy.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 They say it in the song.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 I know, I heard it.  I musta zoned
                 out whenever that part came on
                 before.  I thought when she said
                 that little sister stuff, she was
                 talkin about her sister- in-law,
                 the cheatin wife.

                              JOE
                 No, she did it.  She killed the
                 cheatin wife, too.

                              MR. PINK
                 You know the part in "Gypsies,
                 Tramps and Theives," when she says
                 "Poppa woulda shot his if he knew
                 what he'd done?"  I could never
                 figure out what he did.

       The table laughs.  The WAITRESS comes over to the table.
       She has the check, and a pot of coffee.

                              WAITRESS
                 Can I get anybody more
                 coffee.

                              JOE
                 No, we're gonna be hittin it.
                 I'll take care of the check.

       She hands the bill to him.

                              WAITRESS
                 Here ya go.  Please pay at the
                 register, if you wouldn't mind.

                              JOE
                 Sure thing.

                              WAITRESS
                 You guys have a wonderful day.

       They all mutter equivalents.  She exits and Joe stands up.

                              JOE
                 I'll take care of this, you guys
                 leave the tip.
                         (to Mr. White)
                 And when I come back, I want my
                 book back.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Sorry, it's my book now.

                              JOE
                 Blonde, shoot this piece of shit,
                 will ya?

       Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger.  Mr White
       acts shot.  Joe exits.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                Okay, everybody cough up green for
                the little lady.

       Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.
       Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 C'mon, throw in a buck.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Uh-uh.  I don't tip.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 Whaddaya mean you don't tip?

                              MR. WHITE
                 I don't believe in it.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 You don't believe in tipping?

                              MR. PINK
                         (laughing)
                 I love this kid, he's a madman,
                 this guy.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Do you have any idea what these
                 ladies make?  They make shit.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Don't give me that.  She don't
                 make enough money, she can quit.

       Everybody laughs.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 I don't even know a Jew who'd have
                 the balls to say that.  So let's
                 get this straight. You never ever
                 tip?

                              MR. WHITE
                 I don't tip because society says I
                 gotta.  I tip when somebody
                 deserves a tip.  When somebody
                 really puts forth an effort, they
                 deserve a little something extra.
                 But this tipping automatically,
                 that shit's for the birds.  As far
                 as I'm concerned, they're just
                 doin their job.

                              MR. BLUE
                 Our girl was nice.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Our girl was okay.  She didn't do
                 anything special.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 What's something special, take ya
                 in the kitchen and suck your dick?

       They all laugh.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 I'd go over twelve percent for
                 that.

                              MR. WRITE
                 Look, I ordered coffee.  Now we've
                 been here a long fuckin time, and
                 she's only filled my cup three
                 times.  When I order coffee,  I
                 want it filled six times.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 What if she's too busy?

                              MR. WHITE
                 The words "too busy" shouldn't be
                 in a waitress's vocabulary.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last
                 thing you need is another cup of
                 coffee.

       They all laugh.

                              MR. WHITE
                 These ladies aren't starvin to
                 death.  They make minimum wage.
                 When I worked for minimum wage, I
                 wasn't lucky enough to have a job
                 that society deemed tipworthy.

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 Ahh, now we're getting down to it.
                 It's not just that he's a cheap
                 bastard--

                              MR. ORANGE
                 --It is that too--

                              NICE GUY EDDIE
                 --It is that too.  But it's also
                 he couldn't get a waiter job.  You
                 talk like a pissed off dishwasher:
                 "Fuck those cunts and their
                 fucking tips."

                              MR. BLONDE
                 So you don't care that they're
                 counting on your tip to live?

       Mr. White rubs two of his fingers together.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Do you know what this is?  It's
                 the world's smallest violin,
                 playing just for the waitresses.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 You don't have any idea what
                 you're talking about.  These
                 people bust their ass. This
                 is a hard job.

                              MR. WHITE
                 So's working at McDonald's, but
                 you don't feel the need to tip
                 them.  They're servin ya food, you
                 should tip em.  But no, society
                 says tip these guys over here, but
                 not those guys over there.  That's
                 bullshit.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 They work harder than the kids at
                 McDonald's.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning
                 fryers.

                              MR. BROWN
                 These people are taxed on the tips
                 they make.  When you stiff 'em,
                 you cost them money.

                              MR. BLONDE
                 Waitressing is the number one
                 occupation for female non-college
                 graduates in this country.  It's
                 the one jab basically any woman
                 can get, and make a living on.
                 The reason is because of tips.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Fuck all that.

       They all laugh.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Hey, I'm very sorry that the
                 government taxes their tips.
                 That's fucked up.  But that ain't
                 my fault.  it would appear that
                 waitresses are just one of the
                 many groups the government fucks
                 in the ass on a regular basis.
                 You show me a paper says the
                 government shouldn't do that, I'll
                 sign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll
                 vote for it.  But what I won't do
                 is play ball.  And this non-
                 college bullshit you're telling
                 me, I got two words for that:
                 "Learn to fuckin type."  Cause if
                 you're expecting me to help out
                 with the rent, you're in for a big
                 fuckin surprise.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 He's convinced me.  Give me my
                 dollar back.

       Everybody laughs.  Joe's comes back to the table.

                              JOE
                 Okay ramblers, let's get to
                 rambling.  Wait a minute, who
                 didn't throw in?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Mr. White.

                              JOE
                         (to Mr. Orange)
                 Mr. White?
                         (to Mr. White)
                 Why?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 He don't tip.

                              JOE
                         (to Mr. Orange)
                 He don't tip?
                         (to Mr. White)
                 You don't tip?  Why?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 He don't believe in it.

                              JOE
                         (to Mr. Orange)
                 He don't believe in it?
                         (to Mr. White)
                 You don't believe in it?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Nope.

                              JOE
                         (to Mr. Orange)
                 Shut up!
                         (to Mr. White)
                 Cough up the buck, ya cheap
                 bastard, I paid for your goddamn
                 breakfast.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Because you paid for the
                 breakfast, I'm gonna tip.
                 Normally I wouldn't.

                              JOE
                 Whatever.  Just throw in your
                 dollar, and let's move.
                         (to Mr. Blonde)
                 See what I'm dealing with here.
                 Infants.  I'm fuckin dealin with
                 infants.

       The eight men get up to leave.  Mr. White's waist is in
       the F.G.  As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's
       carrying a gun.  They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House,
       talking amongst themselves.


2      EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

       CREDIT SEQUENCE:

       When the credit sequence is finished, we    FADE TO BLACK:

       Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in
       agony.

       Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING
       ASS, through traffic.

       Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY
       ELSE SAY:

                              SOMEBODY ELSE (OS)
                 Just hold on buddy boy.

       Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:

                            SOMEBODY (OS)
                 I'm sorry.  I can't believe
                 she killed me.  Who would've
                 fuckin thought that?

                                                        CUT TO:

3      INT. GETAWAY GAR (MOVING) - DAY

       The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange.  He lies in the
       backseat.  He's been SHOT in the stomach.  BLOOD covers
       both him and the backseat.

       Mr. White is the Somebody Else.  He's behind the wheel of
       the getaway car.  He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and
       out of traffic.  Though he's driving for his life, he
       keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.

       They are the only two in the car.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Hey, just cancel that shit right
                 now!  You're hurt.  You're hurt
                 really fucking bad, but you ain't
                 dying.

                              MR. ORANGE
                         (crying)
                 All this blood is scaring the shit
                 outta me.  I'm gonna die, I know
                 it.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you
                 had a degree in medicine.  Are you
                 a doctor?  Are you a doctor?
                 Answer me please, are you a
                 doctor?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 No, I'm not!

                              MR. WRITE
                 Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know
                 what you're talking about.  So if
                 you're through giving me your
                 amateur opinion, lie back and
                 listen to the news.  I'm taking
                 you back to the rendezvous, Joe's
                 gonna get you a doctor, the
                 doctor's gonna fix you up, and
                 you're gonna be okay.  Now say it:
                 you're gonna be okay.  Say it:
                 you're gonna be okay!

       Mr. Orange doesn't respond.  Mr. White starts pounding on
       the steering wheel.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Say-the-goddamn-words: you're
                 gonna be okay!

                              MR. ORANGE
                 I'm okay.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (softly)
                 Correct.

4      INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

       The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse.  Then the
       door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of
       Mr. Orange inside.

       Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.

       Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Just hold on buddy boy.  Hold on,
                 and wait for Joe.  I can't do
                 anything for you, but when Joe
                 gets here, which should be anytime
                 now, he'll be able to help you.
                 We're just gonna sit here, and
                 wait for Joe.  Who are
                 we waiting for?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Joe.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Bet your sweet ass we are.

       Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl
       around the warehouse.

                              MR. ORANGE
                         (yelling)
                 Don't leave me!

       Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.

                              MR. WHITE
                 I ain't going anywhere.  I'm right
                 here.  I'm not gonna leave ya.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Larry, I'm so scared, would you
                 please hold me.

       Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange.
       Cradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.

                              MR. WHITE
                         (whispering)
                 Go ahead and be scared, you've
                 been brave enough for one day.  I
                 want you to just relax now.
                 You're not gonna die, you're gonna
                 be fine.  When Joe gets here,
                 he'll make ya a hundred percent
                 again.

       Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress.  He's
       still holding his hand.  Mr. Orange looks up at his
       friend.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Look, I don't wanna be a fly in
                 the ointment, but if help doesn't
                 come soon, I gotta see a doctor.
                 I don't give a fuck about jail, I
                 just don't wanna die.

                              MR. WHITE
                 You're not gonna fucking die, all
                 right?

                              MR. ORANGE
                 I wasn't born yesterday.  I'm
                 hurt, and I'm hurt bad.

                              MR. WHITE
                 It's not good...

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Hey, bless your heart for what
                 you're trying to do.  I was
                 panicking for a moment, but I've
                 got my senses back now.  The
                 situation is, I'm shot in the
                 belly.  And without medical
                 attention, I'm gonna die.

                              MR. WHITE
                 I can' take you to a hospital.

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Fuck jail!  I don't give a shit
                 about jail.  But I can't die.  You
                 don't have to take me in.  Just
                 drive me up to the front, drop me
                 on the sidewalk.  I'll take care
                 of myself.  I won't tell them
                 anything.  I swear to fucking god,
                 I won't tell 'em anything.  Look
                 in my eyes, look right in my eyes.
                         (Mr. White does)
                 I-won't-tell-them-anything.
                 You'll be safe.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Lie back down, and try to--

                              MR. ORANGE
                 I'm going to die!   I need a
                 doctor!  I'm begging you,
                 take me to a doctor.
       
       Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress.  Spent from
       his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:

                              MR. ORANGE
                 Take me to a doctor, take me to a
                 doctor, please.

       Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr.
       Pink steps inside.

                              MR. PINK
                 Was that a fucking set-up or what?

       Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.

                              MR. PINK
                 Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.

       Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Gun shot.

                              MR. PINK
                 Oh that's just fucking great!
                 Where's Brown?

                              MR. WHITE
                 Dead.

                              MR. PINK
                 Goddamn, goddamn!  How did he die?

                              MR. WHITE
                 How the fuck do you think?  The
                 cops shot him.

                              MR. PINK
                 Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
                         (referring to Mr.
                          Orange)
                 Is it bad?

                              MR. WHITE
                 As opposed to good?

                              MR. PINK
                 This is so fucked up.  Somebody
                 fucked us big time.

                              MR. WHITE
                 You really think we were set up?

                              MR. PINK
                 You even doubt it?  I don't think
                 we got set up, I know we got set
                 up!  I mean really, seriously,
                 where did all those cops come
                 from, huh?  One minute they're not
                 there, the next minute
                 they're there.  I didn't hear any
                 sirens.  The alarm went off, okay.
                 Okay, when an alarm goes off, you
                 got an average of four minutes
                 response time.  Unless a patrol
                 car is cruising that street, at
                 that particular moment, you got
                 four minutes before they can
                 realistically respond.  In one
                 minute there were seventeen blue
                 boys out there.  All loaded for
                 bear, all knowing exactly what the
                 fuck they were doing, and they
                 were all just there!  Remember
                 that second wave that showed up in
                 the cars? Those were the ones
                 responding to the alarm.  but
                 those other motherfuckers were
                 already there, they were waiting
                 for us.
                         (pause)
                 You haven't thought about this?

                              MR. WHITE
                 I haven't had a chance to think.
                 First I was just trying to get the
                 fuck outta there.  And after we
                 got away, I've just been dealin
                 with him.

                              MR. PINK
                 Well, you better start thinking
                 about it.  Cause I, sure as fuck,
                 am thinking about it.  In fact,
                 that's all I'm thinking about.  I
                 came this close to just driving
                 off.  Whoever set us up, knows
                 about this place.  There could've
                 been cops sitting here waiting for
                 me.  For all we know, there's
                 cops, driving fast, on their way
                 here now.

                              MR. WHITE
                 Let's go in the other room...

       The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner.  We
       move past it, and see down a hall.
